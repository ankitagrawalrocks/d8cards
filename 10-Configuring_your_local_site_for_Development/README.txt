Objective:
Over the earlier tutorials, you would have noticed that Drupal would not always listen to your code changes although you had turned off caching. Looks like in D8, there is more that you would have to do to your D8 site to turn off caching completely, than just turning it off on the performance settings page.
In this session, we will learn about:
  - Setting up your settings.local.php
  - Null Cache Service
  - Disabling Twig Cache
  - rebuild.php



Exercise:
On your local D8 site, perform all the configuration changes mentioned on the primary video tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsOxSuJ4OU )

Watch the primary tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRsOxSuJ4OU ), and make changes as per the tutorial on your local, for reference I have added the updated files in this folder.
