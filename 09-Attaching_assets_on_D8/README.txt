Objective:
We are all familiar with the multiple ways of adding JS/CSS to a module or a theme to be available on select / all pages on D7.
In this exercise we will check out how we could do the same on D8.



Exercise:
1. Create a custom module and add a CSS and JS file in appropriate subdirectories in the module.

2. Create a libraries.yml file and define 2 libraries Â­ one for each of the CSS and JS

3. Attach the CSS such that it is loaded for all Table elements shown anywhere on the site.

4. Take any custom block that you have built over the previous exercises. Modify the build() to attach the JS to be loaded whenever the block is displayed.
