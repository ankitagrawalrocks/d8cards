Objective:
At the end of this exercise, you might be able to understand
  - What is dependency injection
  - Building Services and why build services?
  - Core Services



Exercise:
This is not a Drupal API to have an exercise for itself. But a way of writing code. And if we learn it right all further exercises would themselves be an exercise for this topic. So take some additional time in going through this video series instead of an exercise dedicated for this topic.  I have done this series and found it to be the best one I could come across in explaining the concepts of Dependency Injection and Services to anyone who is new to Object Oriented Programming!

Donâ€™t be scared by the long list below. All of them are 3 minutes or shorter. And d.me allows you to watch the videos at 1.5x speed which is probably the speed at which this group will watch most of their videos at. The whole playlist should not take more than 20 mins.
